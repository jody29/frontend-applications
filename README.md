## üí° Concept
The concept for this project is to render a map of all the municipalities in the Netherlands. Every municipality gets a color which represents the percentage of people who are vaccinated in that municipality. This will show in which municipalities the most people are vaccinated. This will also show which municipalities have a low vaccination percentage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone the repo to your own device
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jody29/frontend-applications.git
```
install the npm dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```
run the server on your browser
```bash
$ npm start
```

## :pray: Wishlist
* I wanted a filter that the user can chose if he wants to see the municipalities or the safety regions.


## :white_check_mark: Assignment
Create a client-side application in JavaScript which dynamically renders data to views using either a front-end framework or system created by you. Reflect on the merits and costs of frameworks together.
