## üí° Concept
The concept for this project is to render a map of all the municipalities in the Netherlands. Every municipality gets a color which represents the percentage of people who are vaccinated in that municipality. This will show in which municipalities the most people are vaccinated. This will also show which municipalities have a low vaccination percentage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone the repo to your own device
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jody29/frontend-data.git
```

## :pray: Wishlist
* When clicking on a municipality, zoom to the municipality
* Have the geojson file of 2021, because 3 municipalities have fused into one

## :white_check_mark: Assignment
Create a data visualisation (using the d3 library) based on given data where data can be explored through interaction using enter(), update(), and exit().

      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">Student understands how components, state, lifecycle works in their app. The project is structured logically. Merits of frameworks can be explained</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; student used or wrote code not covered in class that was carefully chosen while weighing alternatives</td>
